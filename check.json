Adjust the code to resolve this issue.", "result": "The error occurs because you are trying to concatenate a string with a list in the `sum_function` function. To resolve this issue, you can convert the list to a string before concatenating it with the string. Here's the adjusted code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_function(a, b):\n    return a + str(b)\n\nsum_function(\"a\", [\"b\", \"b\", \"b\"])\n```\n\nThis code will convert the list `[\"b\", \"b\", \"b\"]` to a string before concatenating it with the string \"a\".", "source_documents": [
